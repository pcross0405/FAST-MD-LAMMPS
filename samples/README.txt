An example script using the FAST-MD tools with lammps

This example transforms NiSi2 to B-FeSi2 by enforcing 
the 18-n rule with n = 2

Instructions to run example:

1) Copy all files in samples directory to your working directory

2) Make sure you have properly installed the fast_md package

3) In the command line type "python3 example_run.py"
   (If you are logged on an HPC make sure you enter an interactive job first)

4) Wait for progress bar to reach 100% and print out "COMPLETE!"

5) Visualize simulation by opening the dump.out file in your application of choice (i.e. OVITO)
